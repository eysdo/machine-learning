# machine-learning

This repository will record my machine learning process, and I'll write some blogs to make it easier to understand. for you reading experience, please click my [blogs](http://fitzeng.org/) learn more.

## 1 Algorithm
The plan is I'll spend a lot of times on visualizing some popular algorithms in machine learning field. I'll follow this [blog](https://juejin.im/post/5a66b9e16fb9a01caa20ab8d) to introduce algorithms from easy to hard. I think I must point out if you know nothing about math(it represents `probability and statistics`, `calculous`ï¼Œ `linear algebra` and etc...), I recommend you to learn more basic knowledges by reading my [blogs](http://fitzeng.org/) or searching on the internet.


### ## TODO
